## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an information technology teacher at the No. 2 Middle School of Yongxiu County, Jiangxi Province. I am responsible for teaching Basic Information Technology, Introduction to Programming and other courses, and I am committed to cultivating students' digital literacy and collaboration ability through practical projects. Because the school has not assigned an education email address, I have verified my identity through the teacher ID card/school official website information

ðŸ’» GitHub teaching integration plan
Classroom practice: Plan to use GitHub Classroom to manage student programming assignments and establish a standardized process for code submission and feedback

Open resources: Create an open course repository to share lesson plans, project templates and student work cases

Collaborative initiation: Guide students to create personal accounts, participate in class project collaboration through Fork/Pull Request, and master the basics of version control

âœ¨ Application objectives
Apply for GitHub Teacher Benefits to:

Use a private repository to securely host classroom management data with student names

Improve grading efficiency by automating student code assignments through Actions

Get a GitHub student developer Kit for students (e.g. JetBrains education license)

School's official website: www.yxxz2z.com

Thanks for reviewing! We hope to build a more open technology education platform with the help of GitHub.
